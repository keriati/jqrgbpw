jQuery RGB Password Plugin
==========================

Generates a simple RGB pattern based on the password input. The idea is that the input is recognisable by the user so
that they understand their password to be entered correctly before submitting.

Idea based on a Twitter conversation between @jamesrwhite and @skattyadz
